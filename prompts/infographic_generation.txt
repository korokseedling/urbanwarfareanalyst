Generate a tactical infographic showing a top-down view of the urban warfare training frames.

VIDEO: {video_name}
DURATION: {duration}s
FRAMES ANALYZED: {frame_count}

FRAME DATA:
{frame_summaries}

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
- Average Score: {avg_score}/100
- Total Soldiers: {total_soldiers}
- Total Tactical Errors: {total_errors}
- Total Tactical Strengths: {total_strengths}

INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS:

Create a professional military-style tactical infographic with the following layout:

**LAYOUT STRUCTURE:**
1. **Title Bar** (Top):
   - "TACTICAL ANALYSIS - {video_name}"
   - Overall score badge prominently displayed
   - Duration and frame count

2. **Frame Panels** (Main Area):
   - Show {frame_count} panels side-by-side or in a grid
   - Each panel shows ONE frame from a TOP-DOWN perspective
   - Use a 3D isometric or bird's-eye view style

3. **For Each Frame Panel:**

   a) **Coverage Zones (Color-coded):**
      - GREEN zones: Areas covered by soldier's line of fire (safe zones)
      - RED/PINK zones: Blindspots/uncovered areas (danger zones)
      - GRAY zones: Walls/obstacles
      - Use semi-transparent colored overlays on floor plan

   b) **Soldier Positions:**
      - Show soldiers as numbered icons (1, 2, 3, 4)
      - Position them accurately in the room layout
      - Small circles or tactical symbols

   c) **Coverage Arcs:**
      - Draw green arcs/wedges showing each soldier's field of fire
      - Wider arc = better coverage
      - Overlapping arcs = good cross-coverage

   d) **Key Info Per Frame:**
      - Timestamp (e.g., "9.4s")
      - Frame score (e.g., "85/100")
      - Formation type (e.g., "Column", "Split-stack")

4. **Legend** (Bottom or Side):
   - Green = Covered/Safe zone
   - Red = Blindspot/Danger zone
   - Gray = Walls/Obstacles
   - Numbered icons = Soldier positions

5. **Summary Section** (Bottom):
   - Key Strengths (bullet points, max 3)
   - Key Errors (bullet points, max 3)
   - Training Recommendations (bullet points, max 3)

**VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES:**

- Use a clean, modern military aesthetic
- Similar to tactical briefing materials or game UI (Rainbow Six, ARMA style)
- Dark background with bright accent colors
- Grid lines or coordinate markings for spatial reference
- Professional fonts (sans-serif, military-style)
- High contrast for readability
- Include subtle 3D perspective or isometric view
- Make coverage zones semi-transparent (70-80% opacity)

**SPATIAL REPRESENTATION:**

For each frame, represent the room/area layout:
- Doorways as openings in walls
- Corners clearly defined
- Entry points marked
- Show depth/perspective (not flat 2D)
- Maintain consistent orientation across all frame panels

**COLOR PALETTE:**

- Background: Dark gray (#2a2a2a) or military green
- Safe zones: Bright green (#00ff00, 70% opacity)
- Danger zones: Red (#ff0000, 70% opacity) or pink (#ff5555)
- Walls: Medium gray (#666666)
- Text: White (#ffffff) or light gray (#cccccc)
- Accents: Yellow/gold for highlights
- Score badges: Color-coded (green >90, yellow 70-89, orange 50-69, red <50)

**REFERENCE STYLE:**

The infographic should look similar to tactical planning diagrams, with:
- Top-down room layouts showing clear zones of control
- Visual representation of fields of fire
- Easy identification of coverage gaps
- Professional military briefing quality
