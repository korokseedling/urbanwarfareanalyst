INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Soldier Identification**: Locate each visible soldier in the frame
   - Provide percentage-based coordinates (0-100% from left/top) centered on the soldier's torso
   - Calculate their threat axis (direction they're aiming)
   - Use 0-360 degree system (0=east/right, 90=south/down, 180=west/left, 270=north/up)

2. **Threat Axis (Weapon Direction) - CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT**:
   - CAREFULLY examine where each soldier's weapon muzzle is pointed
   - Look at the weapon barrel direction, NOT body orientation
   - Consider soldier's stance, weapon position, and line of sight
   - Arrow must accurately represent the weapon's firing direction
   - Use clock positions for reference (then convert to degrees):
     * 12 o'clock (straight up) = 270°
     * 1 o'clock = 300°
     * 2 o'clock = 330°
     * 3 o'clock (right) = 0°
     * 4 o'clock = 30°
     * 5 o'clock = 60°
     * 6 o'clock (straight down) = 90°
     * 7 o'clock = 120°
     * 8 o'clock = 150°
     * 9 o'clock (left) = 180°
     * 10 o'clock = 210°
     * 11 o'clock = 240°
   - Length should be proportional to their effective coverage range (15-25% typical)

3. **Blindspot Identification**:
   - Identify areas NOT covered by any soldier's line of fire
   - Common blindspots: corners, behind doors, dead angles, areas behind cover
   - Prioritize HIGH severity blindspots that pose immediate danger
   - Limit to 3-5 most critical blindspots

TACTICAL ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Soldiers facing doorways: 0° or 180° typically
- Soldiers at corners: 45°, 135°, 225°, or 315° angles
- Overlapping fields of fire indicate good coverage
- Gaps between threat axes indicate potential vulnerabilities

WEAPON DIRECTION ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Locate the soldier's weapon (rifle/carbine)
2. Trace the weapon barrel from stock to muzzle
3. Note where the muzzle is pointing in the frame
4. Determine clock direction from soldier to target area
5. Convert to degrees using the clock reference above

CRITICAL VISUAL CUES FOR WEAPON DIRECTION:
- Look at the ANGLE of the rifle barrel in the image
- Check if the weapon is pointed DOWNWARD (6 o'clock = 90°) - barrel angles down toward floor
- Check if weapon is pointed HORIZONTALLY (3 o'clock = 0° or 9 o'clock = 180°) - barrel parallel to ground
- Check if weapon is pointed UPWARD with angle (1-2 o'clock = 300-330°) - barrel angles up
- Soldiers aiming at FLOOR/GROUND level targets = 6 o'clock (90°)
- Soldiers in CQB/room clearing often aim DOWNWARD = 6 o'clock (90°)

COMMON SCENARIOS:
- Soldier aiming INTO a doorway (towards interior) = depends on door position
- Soldier aiming DOWN at floor level during entry = 6 o'clock (90°)
- Soldier clearing room with weapon pointed down = 6 o'clock (90°)
- Soldier covering corner to their right with slight upward angle = 2 o'clock (330°)
- Soldier covering corner to their left = 9-10 o'clock (180-210°)
- Multiple soldiers entering room aiming at ground level = ALL 6 o'clock (90°)

IMPORTANT CORRECTIONS FOR TYPICAL ERRORS:
- If soldiers are in a room entry/breach and aiming LOW (not at standing target height), direction should be 6 o'clock (90°)
- If a soldier at bottom of frame is covering into room, likely 2 o'clock (330°) for slight upward angle
- Default to 6 o'clock (90°) for soldiers in dynamic entry posture with lowered weapons

BE PRECISE: The arrow must follow the actual weapon barrel direction visible in the image.
VERIFY: If weapon muzzle points toward floor/ground = 6 o'clock (90°)

Return ONLY valid JSON with precise coordinates and directions.
